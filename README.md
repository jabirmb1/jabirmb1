# Hi there 👋 I'm Jabir! ✨

"I'm a CS and AI student hoping to become a Web Developer or an AI Researcher! Coding has been a rollercoaster with many highs and lows, but it's nevertheless been an absolute joy."

## 🔭 Current Projects:

 1. Moodroom - Being an INFJ, I love showing my feelings even in coding.
 2. SeoulScript - I'm a huge drama fan. (I highly recommend checking out "Welcome to Waikiki"; it's an absolute comedy that will completely hook you!)
 3. DevSphere - I'm trying to develop a useful, cloud-based tool to improve workflows and productivity.🏢
    
      & Many More ...

 ## 🌱 Learning and growing:
 Focusing on python to better improve my skills in AI related development and projects✨
